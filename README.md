Heart Disease Detector

Abstract

The Heart Disease Detector is a Machine Learning Model designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analysze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.
